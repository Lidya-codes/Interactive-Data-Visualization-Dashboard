# Interactive Data Visualization Dashboard

This project is an interactive data visualization dashboard developed as part of the ICT305 – Data Visualisation and Simulation unit. The dashboard demonstrates how raw data can be transformed into clear, insightful, and interactive visual narratives using modern visualization principles and Python-based tools.
The focus of this project is not only on creating charts, but on applying good UI/UX design, data storytelling, and best visualization practices to support user understanding and decision-making.

Project Objectives
* Explore and analyse real-world data using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Design clear and effective visualizations that reinforce human cognition
* Implement interactive features to enhance user experience
* Apply UI and UX principles such as visibility, feedback, consistency, and usability
* Avoid common data visualization pitfalls such as clutter, misleading scales, and poor feature selection

Technologies & Tools
* Python
* Jupyter Notebook / Jupyter Lab
* pandas – data handling and preprocessing
* numpy – numerical operations
* matplotlib & seaborn – static visualizations
* Plotly / Altair / Bokeh – interactive visualizations

Dashboard Features
* Interactive charts and graphs
* Hover tooltips for additional context
* Filters and selections for data exploration
* Clear labeling, legends, and consistent color usage
* Visualizations designed for comparison, relationships, time, and patterns

Design Principles Applied
* Affordance: Visual elements clearly indicate how they should be used
* Visibility: All key actions and information are easy to find
* Feedback: User interactions provide immediate visual responses
* Consistency: Similar elements behave the same across the dashboard
* Usability & Efficiency: Designed for both novice and experienced users
